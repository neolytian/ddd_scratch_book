# Slicing the Reality

Slicing the reality in modelling comes from a discussion session I participated with [Mathias Verraes](https://verraes.net/) at the [DDD Europe 2021](https://dddeurope.com/). He formulated the idea of "Fractal inconsistencies". The idea is that each action or event creates physical imbalance which requires some action to be taken or event to happen. Based on the Event Storming we did as a modelling exercise we saw that Event Storming results can be broken down into different slices per persona. The hypothesis was, that each person has only a limited perception of the reality or of a process. So it is possible to model processes based on different personas and create better picture of the reality by putting the different slices of reality together.

## What is Domain Driven Design?

[Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) is a discipline in software modelling. The term was invented by [Eric Evans](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/).

The concept of Domain Driven Design revolves around the idea that the language of the code should match the language of the business domain, the [Ubiquitous Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html).
